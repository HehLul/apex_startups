      question: "What is your onboarding process like?",
      answer:
        "We start with a discovery call to understand your vision and goals. Within 24 hours, you'll receive a detailed project timeline and scope breakdown. Then we schedule a follow-up call to finalize details, explain pricing, and discuss the payment process. After that call, you'll receive a contract and can send your deposit to kick off development.",
    },

    {
      question: "Any work you don't cover?",
      answer:
        "We specialize in MVPs, SaaS platforms, Web applications and React Native mobile apps. We don't handle native iOS/Android development, blockchain/crypto projects, or adult content and gambling platforms. For projects outside our scope, we'll let you know upfront so you can find the right specialist.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do the payments work?",
      answer:
        "For our Landing Page package, we require $250 upfront and $250 upon completion. For the MVP package, we require $500 upfront and $1000 upon completion. For custom projects, we work with milestone-based payments. We accept bank transfers, credit cards, and PayPal. All pricing is transparent with no hidden fees. We'll clearly outline any additional costs like hosting or third-party services upfront.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What if I don't have a clear idea or need help with technical strategy?",
      answer:
        "We're adaptable and willing to come up with founder-driven solutions for your startup. Whether you have a rough concept or need guidance on technical architecture and feature prioritization, we work closely with founders to refine ideas and build solutions that align with your business goals.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need changes during/after the service?",
      answer:
        "Minor adjustments and reasonable revisions are included in all packages. For significant scope changes during development, we'll provide a transparent quote for additional work.",
